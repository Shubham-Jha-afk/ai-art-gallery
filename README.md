## 🧠 About the AI Art Generation

The current version uses **local fallback images** that simulate the gallery content.

- The AI generation feature is available but requires an **API key** (DeepAI/Unsplash or any supported AI art generator).
- Once configured, users can modify the logic to generate fresh artwork in real-time.
- Great for anyone who wants to personalize or expand the gallery with real-time generation.

> 💡 The fallback mechanism ensures the project remains functional and visually complete even without API setup.
